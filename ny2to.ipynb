    "Imagine you live in busy New York with your family and, although doing fine in the Big Apple, you receive an undeniable job proposal to work on a great company in Toronto, Canada. Despite the fact that New York offers many opportunities for its residents, Canada is a very open-minded and conviviality country, especially when we talk about public health care. \n",

    "Although they are not too far apart (about 8h away by car), moving to another city with the whole family is a big change and requires a lot of planning. After the initial excitement and celebrations, you and your significant other have a lot to plan. Indubitably, to choose to which Toronto's neighborhood you should move to is one of the bigger questions to answer.\n",
    "To decrease the change's impact, you decide to explore Toronto to find a neighborhood as similar as possible to the one you used to live in NY.\n",
